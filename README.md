# SupplyChainCase

This is prototypes implementation of Supply Chain Case, using Blockchain technology. We tokenised products using standard ERC1155 token. Where ERC1155 token creator can generate and deploy the tokens. 

### Simple Case Study
Conside following Figure.
![See File "Business_Case.pdf"](https://github.com/yashmadhwal/SupplyChainCase/blob/main/Business_Case.pdf?raw=true)
Three entities are involded in creating Anti-Aerosol Respirators:
* Respirator Manufacturer
* Filter Manufacturer
* AntiAerosol Manufacturer

Research Paper has detailed description of how it work. This repository will focus more on code reproduction.

### Code Reproduction
Prerequisites:
* Ganache UI or Install Ganache Client. If you don't want to download Ganache UI, the with the following command you can install ganache-cli in your terminal
```npm install -g ganache-cli```
* Download Repository and upload all the contact to Remix IDE. ```http://remix.ethereum.org/```
